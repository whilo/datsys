;; # SCHEMA!

;; This is wildy incomplete still, and subject to change, but it's something to start looking at with respect
;; to what I have in mind.

;; I think for now we'll be using conformity (https://github.com/rkneufeld/conformity) to define "norms" about
;; what we expect to see in the shape of the database.
;; I have a feeling we're going to want to extend this with additional functionality, like :before and :after
;; hooks, :dependencies, etc.
;; It would also be nice to have it spit out the current state of the schema as a new :base-schema for
;; cleanup.
;; It would also be nice to automatically do diffs on the current schema and the existing schema, and try to
;; automatically patch things as well.

{;; ## Catalysis Domain model
 :catalysis/base-schema
 ;; This is how conformity does dependencies (:requires)
 {:requires [:datview/base-schema]
  :txes
  ;; Hmmm... should we have our own partition for datview?
  [;; ### Domain types;
   ;; It's recommended that you put as much of your logic about how types are supposed to related to eachother in the actual Datomic schema.

     :e.type/attributes [:e/name :e/description :e/tags :e/category]
